### What is kurzegeschichte?
kurzegeschichte is a short story portal where users are able to read and write short stories for free. The focus lies on providing texts without any (visual) distractions. The page is still under development and being worked on whenever I have time on my hands. It's a passion project and done without any commercial benefit in mind.

### Let's talk about technologies.
* Backend: Python (Flask) server, MongoDB (Atlas) for storing data, Firebase for App Push Notifications, Pythonanywhere for hosting
* Frontend: Basic HTML, CSS, Javascript (Jquery) and Bootstrap

### How can I contribute?
Currently kurzegeschichte is being developed by [myself](https://www.tobler.io) only BUT if you want to join the project feel free to contact me via info@kurzegeschichte.de or any other channel.
